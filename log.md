# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1/17/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Working on a Habit Tracking App that utilizes React and web development practices to track my 100 days code and other habits I want to add or remove

**Thoughts:** I have been reading and doing a bit of learning on Pluralsite for React but still find that building apps on my own is a little tricky. I also think that since I am the only one working on these that my code is a bit unorganized and cluttered. I will have to spend some time looking at code practices. Glad I started the 100 days of code challenge so I can start a new habit of coding and build fun and useful applications!

### Day 2: 1/18/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Habit Tracker app to give it error handling, separation of concerns and styling

**Thoughts:** I should have followed a nice development process by Sumar Buna but I did not and now have a functioning app that needs styling but am less motivated as it is functional. I need to work on CSS and separating concerns in React using custom hooks, additional React Components. I will strive to complete this today or tomorrow so i can move on to the pagination app.

### Day 3: 1/19/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Completed working on my Habit Tracker app.

**Thoughts:** This was definitely not the best development process and when it came down to creating reusable custom hooks and performance tweaks I was unable to do a lot of them. This opened my eyes and I add a lessons learned to the readme of the github page. I will have to think about these more in future projects and will be starting my next project for pagination or Tic Tac Toe.

### Day 4: 1/20/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Started a google calendar event React App. Using my own React Scaffolding

**Thoughts:** Knew the things needed for scaffolding but first time actually setting it up without a video guide. Takes a lot of work just to get everything to work and little omissions cause the whole thing to break with little warnings. I will do it next project again to get the feel for everything and then will look for a way to easily use it. maybe a github repo i clone for projects? IDK but won't change too often. Also, need to read up more on Google Calendar API to see if my simple app will or will not be so simple.

### Day 5: 1/21/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Changed to generate a calendar file utilizing .ics. Spent most of my day working on CSS layout (grid vs flex, border-box v content box) and React Controlled form.

**Thoughts:** Got a lot better understanding on CSS layouts and using border-box vs content-box to fill whole screen without wacky calc(100vw - xpx) stuff. App is basically done, but I want to use React Composition to make reusable React Form Component.

### Day 6: 1/22/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Calendar event app.

**Thoughts:** Working with Forms in React is a bit of a pain. Will try using a library after I am happy with my pure React design. Also doing deep copying vs shallow copying in JavaScript is kind of a pain. Using JSON for Deep copying but will read up on other ways.

### Day 7: 1/23/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Calendar event app.

**Thoughts:** Only got 1 hour today and worked on markup as I had little motivation and brain power today. Made some cool markup fixes. Tomorrow I am holding myself to finish this Calendar app by 1. creating reusable react components, 2. Using TypeScript with this, 3. Creating This using react form hook or formik.

### Day 8: 1/24/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Calendar event app.

**Thoughts:** Got a decent amount done today. Lot goes into handling forms in React so I hope React form Hook Library makes it a lot easier. Wanted to finish tomorrow but looking at my goals for tomorrow. This might run into Wednesday as well.

**Goals for Tomorrow:**

1. Build basic app with React Form Hook instead of React Forms
2. Make react components for each input in main
3. Add TypeScript to main
4. Add some Tests with JEST and React Testing Library
5. Set up and build a production build

### Day 9: 1/25/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Calendar event app.

**Thoughts:** Struggled a bit today working with React Form Hook as it uses uncontrolled inputs. Going to finish that tomorrow and other tasks I wanted to finish today so I can start working on my next app. I am planning on making a small React app that contains a CSS avatar of myself for my portfolio page.

**Goals for Tomorrow:**

1. Build basic app with React Form Hook instead of React Forms
2. Add TypeScript to main
3. Add some Tests with JEST and React Testing Library
4. Set up and build a production build
5. Start CSS Avatar React App

### Day 10: 1/26/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Finished Calendar app by building a simplified version using React Form Hook and then making a production webpack config and scripts. Start my SVG Avatar project.

**Thoughts:** Production build webpack was not too bad. Just need another repetition or 2 building React Scaffolding and I should have a firm understanding. Start my SVG Avatar project by building a pseudo portfolio site with a working theme button. Tomorrow will be CSS positioning and then a whole lot of SVG work.

**Goals for Tomorrow:**

1. Follow layout of [Cassies site](https://www.cassie.codes/) to handle positioning in my pseudo portfolio site.
2. Work on the styling on the site so I can copy and paste it into my actual portfolio site later
   - COMPLEX CSS
3. Spend a whole lot of time learning and applying SVG and animations

### Day 11: 1/27/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Changed course from SVG Avatar in the footer to creating the layout template for my portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** SVG is crazy hard and maybe too creative for me. I needed to download a special SVG editor and all kinds of stuff, so changed my project to be a template layout for my future portfolio site that will have a finished header and footer and general layout styling for the sections such that I just need to populate the main sections and will be done.

**Goals for Tomorrow:**

1. Finish my Header Component
2. Use React Router to create other pages: projects, blog and contact? maybe resume too that navigate from header
3. Create a CSS layout and React layout component that will be used by all pages on my site
4. Create a final footer with social icons

### Day 12: 1/28/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on React Layout component for portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** A lot of work can go into CSS layout. Also a lot of ways to do the same thing in React. Compostion, configuration, props, context, etc.

**Goals for Tomorrow:**

1. Create a CSS layout and React layout component that will be used by all pages on my site
2. Create a final footer with social icons

### Day 13: 1/29/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Finished React Layout component for portfolio site. Start working on Pagination App

**Thoughts:** Portfolio layout was getting a little stale so moved on to a pagination app that will utilize a lot of things from the first few applications. Excited to build more reusable components and hooks and master composition
