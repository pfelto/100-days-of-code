# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1/17/2022

**Today's Progress**: Working on a Habit Tracking App that utilizes React and web development practices to track my 100 days code and other habits I want to add or remove

**Thoughts:** I have been reading and doing a bit of learning on Pluralsite for React but still find that building apps on my own is a little tricky. I also think that since I am the only one working on these that my code is a bit unorganized and cluttered. I will have to spend some time looking at code practices. Glad I started the 100 days of code challenge so I can start a new habit of coding and build fun and useful applications!

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Habit Tracker app to give it error handling, separation of concerns and styling

**Thoughts:** I should have followed a nice development process by Sumar Buna but I did not and now have a functioning app that needs styling but am less motivated as it is functional. I need to work on CSS and separating concerns in React using custom hooks, additional React Components. I will strive to complete this today or tomorrow so i can move on to the pagination app.
