# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1/17/2022

#####

**Today's Progress**: Working on a Habit Tracking App the utilizes React and web development practices to track my 100 days code and other habits I want to add or remove

**Thoughts:** I have been reading and doing a bit of learning on Pluralsite for React but still find that building apps on my own is a little tricky. I also think that since I am the only one working on these mini projects that my code is a bit unorganized and cluttered. Will have to spend some more time looking at code practices. Glad I started the 100 day challenge so I can apply what I learn to actual applications.
